# TFG-Unreal-Engine
Project developed in Unreal Engine for the TFG of the Video Game Design and Development degree at the Rey Juan Carlos University.

This is a project which seeks to make a technical demo that demonstrates the knowledge of the Unreal Engine program and the use of technologies such as the Gameplay Ability System plugin, making a fighting game where the damage depends on the statistics of resistance, penetration, critical, damage type, etc. of the fighters. Along with its corresponding interface and character selection menus adapted for local multiplayer.

Because the project is focused on the development section (programming) the art of the interfaces is simple, and the 3D assets have been acquired for free from the Unreal Engine Marketplace with open license.
